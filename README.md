#### 13. [Color Extractor](https://github.com/algolia/color-extractor)
This project is both a library and a CLI tool to extract the dominant colors of the main object of an image. Most of the preprocessing steps assume that the images are related to e-commerce, meaning that the objects targeted by the algorithms are supposed to be mostly centered and with a fairly simple background (single color, gradient, low contrast, etc.). The algorithm may still perform if any of those two conditions is not met, but be aware that its precision will certainly be hindered.
